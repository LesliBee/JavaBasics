Scanner class:
Helps us take input from keyboard.
Logical Operators:
    Just another set of symbols that we can use to combine multiple boolean values. There are logical operators ! || &&

Why should we learn about Logical Operators?
    We can greatly simplify the logic if we use these operators

What is the syntax:
    they only work with boolean data type
    if(! condition)
    if(condition1 || condition2)
    if(condition && condition2)


NOT Operator (!)
    Not is used to negate the boolean values of something is, it will make false. If something is false, it will make it
    true.

What is a SwitchCase statement:
    Switch case statement are just another way of achieving the same resukts as if-else-if conditions

Why should we learn about them:
    Because they are very fast

Syntax:

switch (condition) {
    case:1
    {output}
    break;
    case:2
    {output}
    break;
    default:
    {otherwise output}

    }
Rules that we should follow:
    1) we can only use byte short int char String in switch case statements.
    2) we can't use relational operators in switch case statements are also not allowed
