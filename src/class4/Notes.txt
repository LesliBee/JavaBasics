Operators:
    Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition and subtractions. We can compare
    things if two entities are the same or not if a number is greater than the other number or not.
    There are three main types of operators. They are Arithmetic Operators, Relational Operators and Logical Operators.

Arithmetic Operators:
    We use Arithmetic Operators to perform simple math operations like addition, subtraction, etc.
    + => Addition
    - => Subtraction
    / => Division
    * => Multiplication
    % => Modulus, Remainder

Relational Operators:
    Are used to compare two quantities or entities. For example if something is bigger than the other thing or
    if two numbers are the same or not or if two boolean variables contain the same values or not.
    ==  => used to check if two variables contain the same value or not; if same, we get true otherwise we get false.
    !=  => used to check if two variables don't contain the same value. We get a true if they are not the same.
    >   => used to check if one value is greater than the other. If not greater, we get a true.
    <   => used to check if the value on the left is smaller than the value on the right. If so, it will be true.
    >=  => if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right side or if they are the same, we will get a true
    <=  => it's the opposite of >= amd it is used to check if something is less than or equal to the other thing

Conditional Constructs:
    Used to write conditional code. A piece of code that executes based on condition; if condition is true, java
    executes the code, otherwise, it skips the code.
How to write Ifelse "if, else" conditions:
    if(condition){
    any line of code, even another if condition

    if(){

    }

    }

Important Notes:
    1) For String we use equals method instead of === sign because it is a non-primitive data type
    2) We can cmd+opt+l(Mac) ctrl+alt+l(Windows) to format our code
    3) If we are confused about brackets we can click on opening or closing part to check the other part

If else conditions:
    If I have to test the same variable for multiple conditions I should use If else if
    If I have multiple conditions and these conditions are dependent on each other I should us Nested if conditions
