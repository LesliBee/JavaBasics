In programming, if you understand the question, you have already solved 50% of the task. Think of the question in pieces
To ask a user for something you use the Scanner first
Then System.out.println (aka sout)
If asking to ask something a certain # of times:
    for i (run a loop)
    sout (line 3 moves to after the loop because we are asking for a # of times)

Nested for Loops:
    A for loop inside another for loop:
Important points:
    Read the questions carefully!
    Always Break down your problem into smaller steps ALWAYS
    Focus on those smaller parts test them well. If they are working as per your exceptions, once tested, move to second
    part
