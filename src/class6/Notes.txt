Logical Operators:
    Allow us to combine multiple conditions. They only work with boolean (true, false) values
    There are 3 Logical Operators:
        1) !
        2) ||
        3) &&
Why should we use Logical Operators?
    1) They can greatly simplify the logic
    2) It helps us reduce the lines of code that we have to write
NOT (!):
    It reverses the conditions. If something is true it will make it false and if something is false it will make it
    true
    System.out.println(!true) => false
Logical Or Operator (||):
    It can combine two or more conditions and returns true as long as there is one condition is true.
    If all the conditions become false, it returns us a false.
Logical AND (&&):
    It can also combine 2 or more conditions.
