Arrays in java:
    Arrays allow us to store multiple values in a single variable
Why should we use Arrays;
    If we have to store a lot of values, it becomes very hard to manage a lot of variables.
Syntax of Arrays:
    We can create arrays in two different ways.
1st way of creating arrays:
    Datatype[] arr={element 1,element 2,element 3};
    System.out.println(arr[0])
2nd way of creating arrays:
    DataType[] arr=new Datatype[Size]
Note:
    Other than using loops we can also use below syntax:
     int [] arr={10,13,20,25,45,50};
            // Below code prints all the elements from an array without a loop
            System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
