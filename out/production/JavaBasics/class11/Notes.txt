2D Arrays:
    Are arrays that contain 1D arrays
Why should we learn about 2D arrays:
    Because they allow us to store multiple 1D arrays which gives us more flexibility to store data.
        -For example if we have to store data from Excel files we can use 2D arrays
Syntax to create 2D Arrays;
   1 way >> DataType[][] nameOfArray= new DataType[Sizeof Rows][];
   2nd way >> DataType[][] nameOfArray= {{data,data,data},{data,data,data}};

   OOP is nothing but some set of rules that if we follow we achieve below:
   1) Resenting real life entities becomes easier
   2) Code repetition is minimized
   3) Changing existing code becomes easier
   4) Helps write secure code
   5)
